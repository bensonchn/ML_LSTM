# ML_LSTM

## What does it do?
Attempts to predict bitcoin prices using LSTM model.
I attempt to predict 7 days ahead (168 hours) using the hourly closing price.
This LSTM hyperarameters were tuned with Random Search

## Needed Improvements

## How to run it
You simply run the whole code

## Results
In my findings, it would seem that the model is perhaps overfitting
